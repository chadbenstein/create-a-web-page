      <p>Hey Udacity Team! Thank you for taking the time to review and comment on my work. Your feedback is invaluable.</p>

      <p>My tribute page is dedicated to my favorite sports team -- the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>

      <p>Below you can find hyperlinks to the various pages included herein. The tree has many branches!</p>

      <p>Above, if you click the 76ers logo, it will take you to the official team webpage. The Navbar is fixed in its position and contains links to the pages in this site. The HOME button will bring you back here, the ROSTER button takes you more information about the players on the team, and HIGHLIGHTS contains links to highlights for each player on the team.</p>

      <p>Any links to external sites will open in a new tab. Links that send you to pages I created will remain in the same tab.</p>

      <p>Thank you again!</p>

      <p>Best,</p>
      <p>Chad Stein<br>
